# GDHttp
GDHttp (Grupa Doma≈Ñscy Http), a wrapper around `System.Net.HttpListener` 
library that creates express-like experience when creating web-apps 
(Express is a NodeJS web-server library).

It exists, because author of this libraray thinks that ASP.NET is
over-engineered and it tries to do things that can be more simple.

**This lib is not a king of performance**, and it probably never 
will be. It exists, because there is lack of simplicity in web-server 
libs. **If you want performance, go back to ASP.NET.**
